# Gaiaâ€™s Riddle 2: The Forest Keepers

The Forest Keepers is a Minecraft modpack for experienced players adapted from the Reclamation modpack (itself heavily inspired by the venerable Regrowth modpack).

The pack is focused on the restoration, regeneration and stewarding of a dry, dead wasteland back to ecological life through reforestation.

Using your wits, some magic, some luck and the forces of (procedural) nature itself you will work through a custom progression to renew the world to the ecological tipping point bringing hope for a new age of living in harmony with the forests.
